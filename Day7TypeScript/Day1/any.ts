// What is any datatype?
// Any datatype is used to store any type of value in a variable. Scripting languages like JavaScript, TypeScript provides any datatype functionality. C++ also provides this functionality but only with the help of boost library. Any type of value can be assigned to a variable by just making its datatype any

// Any is a data type in TypeScript. Any type is used when we deal with third-party programs and expect any variable but we don't know the exact type of variable. Any data type is used because it helps in opt-in and opt-out of type checking during compilation.


let data : any = 5 ;
let value : any = "string"
value = 10;
